			I am a Russian born American, who can't get enough of travelling. I have been an events manager for the past two years, and the best part of my job was the joy that the guests experienced. Weather is my favourite season, because I was born in February and in Siberia, Russia. Thai is my favourite cuisine and occasionally I treat myself to a home cooked thai green curry. I like to try anything at least once and I am generally very curious about the world around me.
