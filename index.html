			I am a Russian born American, who can't get enough of travelling. I have been an events manager for the past two years, and the best part of my job was the joy that the guests had an amazing experience. Weather is my favourite season, because I was born in February and in Siberia, Russia.

			Thai is my favourite cuisine and occasionally I treat myself to a home cooked thai green curry. I like to try anything at least once and I am generally very curious about the world around me.
